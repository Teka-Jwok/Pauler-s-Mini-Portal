# Pauler-s-Mini-Portal

An android App, that takes students result in excel file and parse it for private view by each student. Intended for use in St. Paul Hospital Millennium Medical College. This app is kind of student controlled just to prevent sharing the students result on telegram, giving just more private view hence a mini portal system!
